# Customer Registration Page (Java) 💻🖱️

A **desktop application** built using *`Java`*, designed to **streamline the process of registering customers**. The application features **a clean and user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and storing customer information effectively.**

## 🛠 Technologies Used:

- `Java (Swing)`: Used for building the graphical user interface and implementing the business logic.

- `File Handling`: Saves and loads customer data from a `.bin` file for persistent storage

## 📂 Features:

*`1. Customer Registration`*

- Add new customer details such as name, contact number, email, and address.

- Validate user input to ensure data integrity (e.g., proper email format, non-empty fields).

*`2. Search and Edit Customer Records`*

- Search for existing customers using their ID or name.

- Update customer details easily to maintain accurate records.

*`3. File-Based Data Storage`*

- Save customer information into a .txt file for long-term storage.

- Load and display customer details from the file upon application startup.

*`4. Responsive UI`*

- A desktop-friendly user interface built using Java Swing, ensuring seamless navigation and interaction.

**⚠ Current Status:**

- The project is fully functional and uses file handling for data storage instead of a database. It is currently optimized for desktop environments.
